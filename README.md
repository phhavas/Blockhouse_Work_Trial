# Blockhouse_Work_Trial

The attached Jupyter notebook file contains
- five new features for the code
- two slippage calculation papers from which one is included in the code.

The two papers are summarised by their abstract and some key bulletpoints.
Please note that the invidual features and the slippage calculation are independent from each other and are not fully implemented in the existing code. Coding the slippage calculation was more challenging than coding the new features. Hence, I spent more time on the second half of the work.
